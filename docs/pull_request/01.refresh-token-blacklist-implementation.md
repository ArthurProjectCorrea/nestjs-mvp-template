## üîÑ Changes Made

<!-- List the main changes introduced by this PR -->

### Database Schema Updates

- Added `Token` model with secure refresh token storage (hashed)
- Added `AuditLog` model for authentication event tracking
- Updated existing `User` model with audit log relations
- Generated Prisma migration: `add_token_and_auditlog`

### Authentication Service Enhancements

- Implemented `generateTokensAndPersist()` method for secure token creation
- Added `enforceSessionLimit()` for configurable concurrent session limits
- Implemented `revokeRefreshTokenByDbRecord()` for proper token cleanup
- Added `refresh()` method with token rotation support
- Enhanced `logout()` and `logoutAll()` methods with audit logging
- Added `listSessions()` and `revokeSession()` for session management
- Implemented `isAccessRevoked()` for JWT guard blacklist checking

### API Endpoints

- Enhanced `POST /auth/login` with device tracking and metadata capture
- Enhanced `POST /auth/logout` with proper token revocation
- Added `POST /auth/refresh` with token rotation support
- Added `GET /auth/sessions` for listing active user sessions
- Added `POST /auth/sessions/:id/revoke` for individual session revocation
- Added `POST /auth/logout-all` for revoking all user sessions

### Redis Integration

- Created `RedisService` for Redis connection management
- Implemented blacklist keys: `bl:access:<jti>`, `bl:refresh:<hash>`
- Added session tracking with sorted sets: `sessions:<userId>`
- Implemented TTL-based automatic cleanup for expired tokens

### Security Features

- Refresh token hashing using SHA-256 for secure storage
- JWT access tokens include unique JTI for blacklist tracking
- Token rotation prevents reuse of refresh tokens
- Session limits prevent unlimited concurrent sessions
- Audit logging for all authentication events

### Testing Coverage

- Enhanced `AuthController` unit tests with new endpoints
- Updated E2E tests covering complete authentication workflows
- Added `RedisService` unit tests
- Added `JwtGuard` tests with Redis integration

### Infrastructure Updates

- Updated `docker-compose.yml` with Redis service
- Added Redis environment variables to configuration
- Updated `package.json` with new dependencies: `ioredis`, `crypto-js`, `date-fns`
- Added TypeScript type definitions for new packages

### Configuration

- Added environment variables: `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER`, `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS`
- Updated `AppModule` to include `RedisService` as global provider
- Enhanced JWT strategy to include JTI in payload

## üé® Motivation and Context

<!-- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->

The current authentication system lacked robust session management and token security features. Refresh tokens could be reused indefinitely, there were no limits on concurrent sessions, and there was no mechanism to revoke tokens immediately when needed. This created security risks such as:

- Token theft exploitation through refresh token reuse
- Unmanaged session accumulation leading to resource waste
- Lack of audit trail for authentication events
- No protection against concurrent session abuse

This implementation addresses these security concerns by introducing a comprehensive token blacklist system with Redis for fast lookups, combined with database persistence for audit trails. The solution includes token rotation, session limits, and automatic cleanup while maintaining backward compatibility during rollout.

  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "User Name"
  }
}

// List active sessions
GET /auth/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

Response:
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "deviceName": "Chrome on Windows",
    "ip": "192.168.1.100",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",

    "lastUsedAt": "2025-10-09T09:15:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### Redis Key Structure

```bash
# Access token blacklist (TTL-based auto-expiry)
bl:access:jti-1234567890

# Refresh token blacklist (TTL-based auto-expiry)
bl:refresh:sha256-hash-of-refresh-token

# User sessions tracking (sorted set by timestamp)
sessions:1 (member: "123", score: 1696848000000)
```

## üìù Additional Notes

<!-- Any additional information that reviewers should know -->

### Security Design Decisions

- **Token Storage**: Refresh tokens are hashed with SHA-256 before database storage
- **Blacklist Strategy**: Redis provides O(1) lookup performance for token validation
- **Session Limits**: Configurable per-user concurrent session limits (default: 5)
- **Token Rotation**: Refresh tokens are rotated on each use to prevent reuse
- **Audit Trail**: All authentication events are logged with metadata

### Performance Considerations

- Redis operations are asynchronous and non-blocking
- TTL-based automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Sorted sets enable efficient session listing and cleanup
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing API endpoints maintain same interface
- New features are additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Token response format includes additional metadata
- Graceful degradation if Redis is unavailable (logs warning)

### Rollout Strategy

1. Deploy database migration in maintenance window
2. Update environment variables in staging
3. Deploy application with Redis dependency
4. Monitor authentication metrics and error rates
5. Enable token rotation after stability verification

## üß™ Testing Instructions

<!-- Describe how to test the changes introduced by this PR -->

### Environment Setup

1. Ensure Redis is running (via Docker Compose)
2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER=5
   ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS=true
   ```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Login with Device Tracking**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}'
   ```

   Expected: Receive access_token, refresh_token, and user data

2. **Test Session Listing**

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/auth/sessions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
   ```

   Expected: Array of active sessions with metadata

3. **Test Token Refresh with Rotation**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/refresh \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"refreshToken":"<refresh_token>"}'
   ```

   Expected: New tokens, old refresh token becomes invalid

4. **Test Session Revocation**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/sessions/123/revoke \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
   ```

   Expected: Session revoked, tokens blacklisted

5. **Test Logout All**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/auth/logout-all \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"refreshToken":"<refresh_token>"}'
   ```
   Expected: All user sessions logged out

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run E2E tests specifically
pnpm test:e2e

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:cov
```

Expected: All tests pass with minimum 80% coverage

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

<!-- Any special deployment considerations or migrations required -->

### Pre-deployment Requirements

1. **Redis Infrastructure**
   - Ensure Redis 7+ is available in production environment
   - Configure Redis persistence and backup strategy
   - Set up Redis monitoring and alerting

2. **Database Migration**

   ```bash
   # Apply Prisma migration
   npx prisma migrate deploy

   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Add to production environment:
   ```bash
   REDIS_HOST=production-redis-host
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   MAX_SESSIONS_PER_USER=5
   ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS=true
   ```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Blue-Green Deployment Recommended**
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Verify Redis connectivity and token operations
   - Test authentication flows end-to-end

2. **Zero-downtime Migration**
   - Database migration is backward compatible
   - Existing tokens remain valid during transition
   - New features activate after deployment

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Monitor Redis memory usage and connection pool
   - Track authentication success/failure rates
   - Set up alerts for token blacklist failures

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Disable Token Rotation**: Set `ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS=false`
2. **Revert to Previous Version**: Standard application rollback
3. **Database Rollback**: If needed, revert migration (data loss possible)
4. **Redis Flush**: Clear blacklist keys if contaminated

### Post-deployment Verification

- Verify login/logout flows work correctly
- Check Redis keys are being created/expired properly
- Confirm audit logs are being written
- Validate session limits are enforced
- Test token refresh rotation behavior
