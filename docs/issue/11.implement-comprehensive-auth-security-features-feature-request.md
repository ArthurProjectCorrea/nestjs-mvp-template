## üí° Problem Statement

### Current Situation

The current authentication system lacks comprehensive security features required for production deployment, including:

- No two-factor authentication (2FA) support
- No password complexity requirements or history tracking
- No rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- No suspicious activity detection based on IP/location
- No audit logging for security events
- No automated cleanup of expired sessions
- Limited protection against session fixation attacks

### Proposed Solution

Implement a complete security enhancement package that includes:

- TOTP-based 2FA with Google Authenticator integration
- Password policies with complexity requirements and history tracking
- Redis-based rate limiting for login attempts
- Geographic IP-based suspicious activity detection
- Comprehensive audit logging system
- Automated cron-based cleanup of expired tokens and sessions
- Enhanced refresh token rotation and encryption

## üé® Feature Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<!-- List what the feature should do -->

- [x] Implement TOTP-based 2FA with setup, enable, disable, and verification endpoints
- [x] Add password policy validation with configurable complexity requirements

## üöÄ Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

<!-- Suggested implementation strategy -->

1. **Phase 1**: Database schema updates and utility functions
   - Create Prisma migration with new models
   - Implement encryption and hashing utilities
   - Add geoip detection helper

2. **Phase 2**: Core security services
   - Implement password policy validation
   - Add audit logging service
   - Create cleanup service with cron jobs

3. **Phase 3**: Authentication enhancements
   - Integrate 2FA with TOTP
   - Add rate limiting with Redis
   - Implement suspicious activity detection

4. **Phase 4**: API endpoints and testing
   - Create 2FA management endpoints
   - Add session management APIs
   - Write comprehensive E2E tests

### Technical Considerations

<!-- Important technical details for implementation -->

- TOTP secrets must be encrypted before database storage
- Redis keys should follow consistent naming conventions
- Geographic detection should handle VPNs and proxies gracefully
- Rate limiting should differentiate between IP and email-based blocking
- Audit logs should be structured for easy querying and analysis
- Cleanup operations should be idempotent and handle failures gracefully

### Breaking Changes

- [x] **No breaking changes** - All features are additive enhancements
- [ ] **Minor breaking changes** (describe below)
- [ ] **Major breaking changes** (describe below)

### Alternatives Considered

<!-- Other approaches that were considered -->

- **JWT-based 2FA**: Considered but TOTP provides better security and user experience
- **In-memory rate limiting**: Considered but Redis provides better scalability for distributed deployments
- **External fraud detection services**: Considered but geoip-lite provides sufficient coverage for initial implementation

### Security Considerations

- All sensitive data uses proper encryption before storage
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Geographic detection helps identify suspicious login patterns
- Audit logging provides forensic capabilities
- Automated cleanup prevents token accumulation
- Password policies enforce strong authentication requirements
